This is just a simple browser game that randomly generates a dungeon using a modified version of the
["random walk algorithm"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk).
You can see a similar implementation in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I74I_MhZIK8).

### Scripts
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app),
so the usual suspects work:
- `npm install` to install the dependencies (make sure you have a node version >= v8.x.x)
- `npm start` to start the development server
- `npm build` to build the production site
